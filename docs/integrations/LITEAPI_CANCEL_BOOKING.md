## Implementation Status: ✅ Complete

---

## End-to-End Cancellation Flow

**Note**: The cancellation flow below may be outdated. Please refer to the current implementation.

### Step 1: Customer Requests Cancellation

Customer or agent initiates cancellation request via API.

### Step 2: Fetch Booking Details from LiteAPI

The system fetches booking details including:

- `cancellationPolicies` - cancellation deadline and fees
- `refundableTag` - "RFN" (refundable) or "NRFN" (non-refundable)
- `payment_transaction_id` - original payment reference
- `voucher_id`, `voucher_total_amount` - if voucher was used

### Step 3: Calculate Refundable Amount

Based on cancellation policy:

- **RFN + Before deadline:** Full refund
- **RFN + After deadline:** Refund minus cancellation fee
- **NRFN:** No refund (or partial based on policy)

### Step 4: Process Refunds

- **Wallet payments:** Credit wallet balance via Wallet Service
- **Card payments:** Initiate refund via Payment Gateway
- **Vouchers:** Reverse voucher redemption

### Step 5: Update Booking Record

Store refund details in booking metadata:

- `refundType`: "full" | "partial" | "none"
- `refundableAmount`, `cancellationFee`
- `refundProcessed`, `refundResult`

### Step 6: Send Notification

Notify customer of cancellation and refund status.

## Refund Calculation Logic

**Note**: The refund calculation logic below may be outdated. Please refer to the current implementation.

### Flow Diagram

```text
1. Fetch booking from LiteAPI
   ↓
2. Check refundableTag (RFN/NRFN)
   ↓
3. If RFN, check cancellation policy
   ├─ Before cancelTime → Full refund
   └─ After cancelTime → Partial refund (minus fee)
   ↓
4. If NRFN → No refund
```

### Implementation

```javascript
// Extract from services/booking-service/src/routes/liteapi.ts
const refundableTag = bookingDetails.refundableTag;
const cancelPolicy =
  bookingDetails.cancellationPolicies?.cancelPolicyInfos?.[0];

if (refundableTag === "RFN" && cancelPolicy) {
  const now = new Date();
  const cancelTime = new Date(cancelPolicy.cancelTime);

  if (now < cancelTime) {
    // Full refund before deadline
    refundableAmount = booking.totalAmount;
    refundType = "full";
  } else {
    // Partial refund after deadline
    cancellationFee = cancelPolicy.amount;
    refundableAmount = booking.totalAmount - cancellationFee;
    refundType = refundableAmount > 0 ? "partial" : "none";
  }
}
```

## Wallet Refund Integration

**Note**: The wallet refund integration details below may be outdated. Please refer to the current wallet service implementation.

### Refund to Wallet

When a booking was paid via WALLET:

1. Call Wallet Service: `POST /wallet/refund`
2. Pass: `userId`, `amount`, `currency`, `bookingId`, `originalTransactionId`
3. Create refund transaction linked to original charge

### Ledger Recording

```typescript
// Wallet ledger must record:
{
  transaction_type: 'REFUND',
  amount: refunded_amount,  // positive for credits
  currency: 'USD',
  booking_id: bookingId,
  reference: original_payment_transaction_id,
  source_txn_id: original_wallet_charge_transaction_id,
  status: 'completed',
  balance_before: 100.00,
  balance_after: 600.00  // original 100 + refund 500
}
```

## Reconciliation

**Note**: The reconciliation process below may be outdated. Please refer to the current reconciliation implementation.

### Pull Cancelled Bookings

```bash
GET /bookings?startDate=2026-02-01&endDate=2026-02-02&status=cancelled
```

### Match Against Wallet Ledger

- Primary: `booking.payment_transaction_id` → `ledger.source_txn_id`
- Verify: `booking.amount_refunded` = `ledger.REFUND.amount`
- Verify: Timestamps within tolerance (±1 hour)
